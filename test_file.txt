I’m a ‘morning person
	
The alarm goes off at 7:00. I wake up, lean over and turn off the alarm. I get up quickly and go downstairs.
I put on the coffee. I go back upstairs and have a shower. I sing a song in the shower. I put on my clothes.
When I come downstairs again, I have my first cup of coffee. Mmmmm! Then I have some toast and a second cup 
of coffee. I wash my cup and tidy up the kitchen. I take my bag and set off to work. It is 8:00 am. I lock up
the house before I go. Sometimes I run to catch the bus. I get on the bus and go for three or four stops.
 Then I get the bus off . I go into work and say “GOOD MORNING!” to my first class. It is 8:45am.
take me on
